## About
Calculators are a very helpful tool that we all use on a regular basis. Why not create one yourself, and make it really special? In this project, you will write a calculator that not only adds, subtracts, and multiplies, but is also smart enough to remember your previous calculations.

## Learning outcomes
Apart from writing a useful program (everyone uses calculators!), you will learn a lot about arrays, stacks, strings, and queues. You will also get closer experience with 2 important data structures: the stack and the queue. You will also get a closer experience with BigInteger class that allows storing large volumes of data with precision for geo-data or physical quantities.

## Example

### Input/ Output - 1
```
8 * 3 + 12 * (4 - 2)
48
2 - 2 + 3
3
4 * (2 + 3
Invalid expression
-10
-10
a=4
b=5
c=6
a*2+b*3+c*(2+3)
53
1 +++ 2 * 3 -- 4

4+3)

```

### Input/ Output - 2
```
112234567890 + 112234567890 * (10000000999 - 999)
1122345679012234567890
a = 800000000000000000000000
b = 100000000000000000000000
a + b
900000000000000000000000
/exit
Bye!
```
