## About
Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. Letâ€™s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!


## Learning outcomes
After finishing this project, you'll get to know a lot about planning and developing a complex program from scratch, using methods, handling errors, and processing user input.

## Example 

The example below shows how your program should work.

Notice that after `Enter the coordinates:` comes the user input.
```
---------
|       |
|       |
|       |
---------
Enter the coordinates: 2 2
---------
|       |
|   X   |
|       |
---------
Enter the coordinates: 2 2
This cell is occupied! Choose another one!
Enter the coordinates: two two
You should enter numbers!
Enter the coordinates: 1 4
Coordinates should be from 1 to 3!
Enter the coordinates: 1 1
---------
| O     |
|   X   |
|       |
---------
Enter the coordinates: 3 3
---------
| O     |
|   X   |
|     X |
---------
Enter the coordinates: 2 1
---------
| O     |
| O X   |
|     X |
---------
Enter the coordinates: 3 1
---------
| O     |
| O X   |
| X   X |
---------
Enter the coordinates: 2 3
---------
| O     |
| O X O |

---------
Enter the coordinates: 3 2
---------
| O     |
| O X O |
