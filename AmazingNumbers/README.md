## About
We use numbers every day. But do you know how many different properties they have? Let's take a look at some of the amazing properties of numbers. After completing this project, you will write a program that knows how to determine whether a number is Palindromic or Gapful, or how to distinguish Spy numbers from others. Numbers can be fascinating!

## Learning outcomes
The project covers basic operations on integers, as well as with Java collections. Make a program that indicates the properties of the numbers taken from the input.

## Project Prerequisites

> Stage 1: Buzz Numbers!

```
Buzz numbers: They are numbers that are either divisible by 7 or end with 7. For example, the number 14 is a

buzz number, since it is divisible by 7 without a remainder; the number 17 ends with 7, so it is also a buzz 

number. However, the number 75 is not a Buzz number, since it is neither divisible by 7 nor does it end with 7. 

The number 7 is a Buzz number too.
