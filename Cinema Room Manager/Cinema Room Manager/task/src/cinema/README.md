## About
Cinema has been a part of the entertainment industry for a long time: a good movie is a way to escape reality and live through a variety of emotions. The best cinema experience you can get is probably in a cinema theatre. In this project, you will create an application that helps manage a cinema theatre: sell tickets, check available seats, see sales statistics, and more.

## Learning outcomes
This project is a good opportunity to work with input and output in Java. You will deal with multi-dimensional arrays and functions as well as loops and conditional statements.

`Arithmetic operations`, `Integer types and operations`, `Boolean and logical operations`, `Relational operators`, 

`Conditional statement`.
##

> Stage 3 (Start: 25-06-2021/ End: 25-06-2021)

`Branching statements`, `Units of information`, `Sizes and ranges`, `Type casting`, `Calling a method`, 

`Primitive and reference types`, `Array`, `Iterating over arrays`, `Multidimensional array`.
##

> Stage 4 (Start: 25-06-2021/ End: 25-06-2021)
